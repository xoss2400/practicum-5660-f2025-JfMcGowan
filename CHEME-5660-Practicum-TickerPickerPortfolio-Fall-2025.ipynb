    "> __Important Note on Negative $\\gamma$ Values:__ In standard Cobb-Douglas theory, all utility weights are positive. However, the $\\texttt{tanh}$ activation function can produce negative values. In our portfolio construction algorithm, we handle this by forcing a minimum share purchase of $\\epsilon$ shares for any asset with $\\gamma_i < 0$. This allows the model to express \"non-preferred but required\" assets, though it does introduce a deviation from strict Cobb-Douglas assumptions. \n",

    "How do we set the $\\xi$ parameter? This parameter controls the influence of the ticker-picker preferences relative to market fundamentals. If the ticker-picker model indicates a strong preference for an asset (i.e., $p_{i}(\\lambda)$ is high), we might want to increase $\\xi$ to give more weight to that preference. Conversely, if the ticker-picker model is uncertain or indicates a low preference, we might decrease $\\xi$ to rely more on market fundamentals.\n",

A higher $\\xi$ places more weight on the investor's subjective preferences, while a lower $\\xi$ emphasizes market-based factors. Adjusting $\\xi$ allows investors to tailor their portfolios according to their confidence in the ticker-picker model versus traditional market indicators. For this practicum, we will use the following heuristic values for $\\xi$ based on the results of the ticker-picker model:\n",

For example, if we set $a_{i} = 1$ for all trading days, we will reallocate the portfolio daily based on updated market information. If we set $a_{i} = 1$ only at the start of each month, we will reallocate monthly.\n",

We then recompute the optimal number of shares (where we now update the $\\gamma_{i}$ coefficients based on the latest market information and ticker-picker preferences) and purchase those shares at a random price during that trading day (between the open and close). If $a_{i} = 0$, we hold the current portfolio allocation.\n",

    "### Reallocation Implementation\n",
    "Let's implement a reallocation strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __Strategy:__ Reallocate the portfolio at each trading day (for reallocation days where $a_{t} = 1$). If $a_{t} = 0$, maintain the previous portfolio. Otherwise, reallocate. \n",
    "> \n",
    "> The reallocation process: \n",
    "> 1. Liquidate the previous portfolio at the market open price to compute total wealth and add this value to the cash on hand. \n",
    "> 2. Update the market context model with current wealth and the EMA-smoothed market growth rate from the previous day. \n",
    "> 3. Compute new optimal share quantities based on updated preferences using [the `shares(...)` function](src/Portfolio.jl). This function solves the Cobb-Douglas investor's optimization problem using the updated $\\gamma_{i}$ coefficients.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> __Note on Transaction Costs:__ This implementation assumes zero transaction costs, zero bid-ask spreads, and no price slippage. In reality, frequent reallocation incurs trading costs that can significantly erode returns. Students should consider adding transaction cost modeling to evaluate whether the reallocation strategy remains attractive under more realistic conditions.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> __Simplifying Assumption on Cash:__ Between reallocation periods, cash holdings are treated as non-earning (no interest accrual). In practice, uninvested cash would typically earn the risk-free rate. \n",
    "> \n",
    "> __Implementation Note:__ We use a deepcopy of the context model to avoid unintended side effects. The budget is updated in-place at each reallocation point, but the deepcopy ensures that the original context model remains unchanged for reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "We store the reallocation results in the `result_dictionary_case_2::Dict{Int,NamedTuple}` dictionary, where the keys are the trading day index and the values are results `NamedTuple` for that day. See [the `shares(...)` function](src/Portfolio.jl) documentation for details on the structure of the results `NamedTuple`."

    "### Question 1\n",
    "How might you modify the $\\mathbf{a}$ reallocation action vector calculation to incorporate your own risk preferences or market views? How do the results differ across the optimistic, neutral, and pessimistic investor moods, and what does this suggest about the robustness of the bandit preferences?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "__Answer 1:__ \n",
    "\n",
    "A practical way to incorporate your own risk preferences or market views into the reallocation rule is to replace the pure bandit cutoff with a risk-aware score before turning it into a binary action. For example, define a composite score\n",
    "\n",
    "$𝑠_𝑖(𝜆)$=$\\gamma_i$ − 𝜆_𝑣 * $\\hat{\\sigma}_i$ − $𝜆_c$ $\\widehat{\\text{cost}}_i$ + $𝜆_𝑑$ * $\\widehat{\\text{diversification}}_i$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\gamma_i$ is the bandit preference, $\\hat{\\sigma}_i$ is an estimate of asset volatility (or downside risk), $\\widehat{\\text{cost}}_i$ proxies transaction costs/illiquidity, and $\\widehat{\\text{diversification}}_i$ rewards low correlation with the current holdings. Then set the inclusion rule to a thresholded action,\n",
    "\n",
    "$𝑎_𝑖$= 1 {$𝑠_𝑖(𝜆)$>$\\tau(\\lambda)$}\n",
    "\n",
    "with the threshold $\\tau(\\lambda)$ (and weights $\\lambda_v,\\lambda_c,\\lambda_d$) tuned by your risk appetite. Equivalent alternatives include “top-$K$ within sector” selection to enforce diversification, capping position sizes via $n_i\\leq b_i(\\lambda)$, or using a soft budgeted selection by converting $s_i$ to weights with $\\tilde{w}_i\\propto \\max{s_i,0}$ and then taking $a_i=\\mathbf{1}{\\tilde{w}_i>0}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The optimistic mood (larger effective weight on $\\gamma_i$ and lower penalty terms) selects more aggressive names, producing higher upside but visibly larger drawdowns/volatility; the pessimistic mood (higher $\\lambda_v$ and/or higher $\\tau$) yields smoother, more capital-preserving trajectories with lower terminal wealth; the neutral setting lies between. That the relative ordering of risk and growth aligns with mood across both buy-and-hold (Case 1) and periodic reallocation (Case 2) suggests the bandit preferences are directionally robust, while the magnitude of outcomes is sensitive to how strongly you penalize volatility/costs and reward diversification. In short: tuning $s_i(\\lambda)$ and $\\tau(\\lambda)$ provides a transparent knob to encode your views, shifting the portfolio along a predictable risk–return continuum\n"

    "### Question 2\n",
    "How does the frequency of portfolio reallocation impact overall performance, and what trade-offs are involved? How would you adapt this reallocation strategy for your own investment approach, considering transaction costs or tax implications?\n",
    "\n",
    "__Answer 2:__ Reallocation frequency governs a classic bias–variance (and cost) trade-off. Higher frequency (e.g., daily/weekly) better tracks time-varying expected returns/preferences and can damp drift in risk (keeping the portfolio near its target exposure), but it raises turnover and therefore implementation shortfall: proportional costs (spreads/commissions), market impact, and slippage. It also increases realized short-term gains, which are typically taxed at higher rates, reducing after-tax performance. Lower frequency (e.g., monthly/quarterly) reduces turnover, costs, and tax drag, but tolerates larger weight drift and may miss regime shifts or new information embedded in the bandit preferences.\n",

    "### Question 3\n",
    "How does the $\\xi$ parameter control the balance between bandit preferences and market fundamentals in the portfolio allocation? What are the implications of the heuristic values used for $\\xi$, and how might you modify this heuristic for your own investment strategy?\n",
    "\n",
    "__Answer 3:__ $\\xi$ is the weight of the investor's preference for the asset as given by the ticker-picker model (default weight of $\\xi = 1$). With a low $\\xi$, the $\\gamma_i^{\\text{bandit}}$ signal dominates—so we lean into names the model “likes,” accepting more idiosyncratic risk and the chance of bigger wins and bigger drawdowns. With a high $\\xi$, we ask the $\\gamma_i^{\\text{fundamental}}$ to “veto” or at least dampen those picks, so we get a steadier, more explainable set of holdings that tends to track broad market risk a bit more closely. The heuristic values we used for $\\xi$ basically pre-pick that balance for us; they work, but they also bake in assumptions about the current regime (volatility, dispersion, factor leadership) that may not hold next month. If the regime shifts, the same $\\xi$ can feel either too aggressive (overshooting into noisy winners) or too conservative (missing upside because $\\gamma_i^{\\text{fundamental}}$ lag).\n",
    "\n",
    "If I were trying to fine tune my own approach, I would lower $\\xi$ when cross-sectional dispersion and realized volatility are high, letting the $\\gamma_i^{\\text{bandit}}$ exploit a wider opportunity set, and raise $\\xi$ with low-dispersion or strssed periods, relying more on $\\gamma_i^{\\text{fundamental}}$. Calibrating by sector or style would help with the unreliable nature of $\\gamma_i^{\\text{fundamental}}$. "

    "## Summary\n",
    "This practicum integrates bandit algorithm results with investor preferences to construct and compare portfolio strategies using dynamic market information.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __Key Takeaways:__\n",
    "> \n",
    "> * **Bandit preferences improve Cobb-Douglas utility coefficients:** Incorporating ticker-picker preferences into the investor utility model enriches portfolio construction beyond market factor information alone, capturing learned patterns from historical asset performance.\n",
    "> * **Reallocation frequency impacts portfolio performance:** Dynamic reallocation allows portfolios to respond to evolving market conditions and preference changes, with potential benefits or costs depending on market regime and transaction considerations.\n",
    "> * **Benchmark comparison validates strategy effectiveness:** Comparing bandit portfolios to passive indexing and risk-free alternatives provides evidence for whether learned preferences generate excess returns relative to simple strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Portfolio construction that adapts to market changes can potentially outperform static strategies through active preference updating.\n",
